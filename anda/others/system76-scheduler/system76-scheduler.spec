%description
Scheduling service which optimizes Linux's CPU scheduler and automatically
assigns process priorities for improved desktop responsiveness. Low latency CPU
scheduling will be activated automatically when on AC, and the default
scheduling latencies set on battery. Processes are regularly sweeped and
assigned process priorities based on configuration files. When combined with
pop-shell, foreground processes and their sub-processes will be given higher
process priority.
